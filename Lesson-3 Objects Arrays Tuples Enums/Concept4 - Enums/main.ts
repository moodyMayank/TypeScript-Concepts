// Enums
// "Unlike most TypeScript features, Enums are not a type-level addition to Javascript but something added to the language and runtime".

// So Basically Javascript is not having the Enums feature and this feature is added by Typescript itself

// Enums are number given to values automatically like here
//  U : 0
//  D : 1
//  C : 2

// We can also start with a default value like U = 10 and others will follow

enum Grade {
  U,
  D,
  C,
  B,
  A,
}
